This website allows users to search for locations on google maps and check whether the reviews are real or not. It does this by running the reviews against a machine learning classifier, which outputs the polarity (i.e. real or fake) and the percent accuracy of that.

Created in 12 hours for TOHacks 2018 in a team of 4.
